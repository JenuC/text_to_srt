00:00:12: Activate napari-virtual environment
00:00:22: Start napari
00:00:25: Start micromanager (MM2)
00:00:32: Load OpenScan-TCSPC device configuration
00:00:47: Open DevicePropertyBrowser
00:00:52: Set a 4digit UDP Tx Port 
00:01:02: Start napari-live-flim:FLIM Viewer Plugin
00:01:07: Set the UDP Rx Port
00:01:27: Start Live Imaging on MM2 :Mixed Pollengrain Sample
00:01:39: Adjust TCSPC-histogram parameters used for fitting/rendering
00:01:50: Photon counts per sec can be monitored in the TCSPC <CFD> parameter
00:02:03: Adjust the excitation laser power by changing Pockelcell voltage to 0.5mV
